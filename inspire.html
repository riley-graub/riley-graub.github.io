        <h1>My Personal Hero</h1>
        <h2>My Little Brother</h2>
        <p>When I think of a hero, I think of someone who is brave, trustworthy, courageous, and valorus. Someone who is willing to do things that make others' lives better. A hero does things in an act of kindness or love, with an intent to do better. When I think of these heroic qualities, I instantly think of my brother, Kane.</p>
        <p>Kane is my younger brother, whom I consider my personal hero. Ever since the moment he was born and I got to hold him for the first time, I knew this kid was going to make a difference in my life for the better. Not only has he lived up to that expectation, but he has exceeded what I thought he would ever be to me. With there being a seven year age difference, I thought I would be the hero that he would look up to. Over the last few years, I realized that I got that completley wrong. He is the hero that I look up to the most, and rely on when things get tough. He teachs me how to be a better person and how to push myself out of my comfort-zone. He guides me through hard times, helps me solve problems, teaches me new things that benefit my life, and brings attention to the things that I shouldn't be doing. All of these characteristics are what make him my personal hero and will forever keep him my personal hero.</p>
        <p>My brother was one of the best people to ever be brought into my life. He has been by my side for 13 years now and I know there is so many more to come. No one can ever compare to the ways he has impacted my life and continues to. I wouldn't be anything near the woman I am today without him. Kane will forever be my little hero!</p>

    <h1>Amusing</h1>
    <h3>by Riley Gauberger</h3>

    <h2>Entertaining</h2>
    <p>Wordle is one of my favorite websites. It provides very interesting and entertainable tasks, as you have to guess the word of the day. I find it to be very amusing.</p>

    <h2>Favorite Laugh</h2>
    <p>This specific video is one of my all time favorite laughs. It is two people arguning over the Wizzard of Oz. I find myself quoting this video all the time. It never gets old and always cracks me up.</p>

    <h2>Classics</h2>
    <p>One of my favorite things is corny dad jokes. There are so many websites that have lists of these jokes, so I just picked one that I've looked at before. Dad jokes are a classic, and they always get people chuckling.</p>
